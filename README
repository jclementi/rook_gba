This directory will hold all of my serious, or at least semi-serious gba
development files. 

Whenever I learn about a specific region of memory or process, I'll first do
some messing around with it in the learning directory. After I feel
comfortable with the process, I'll build all of the tools, reference headers,
and functions I feel might be useful later and store them here.

I expect it will grow slowly, but most good things do.
